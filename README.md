## NUS Fintech Society (ML) Project 2: Natural Language Processing Classifier

### Project Overview

- **Start Date:** 31-10-23
- **Submission Date:** 15-12-2023 11.59pm

### Task

1. Use the dataset `stock_data.csv` to train and build an NLP model to make binary predictions about the comments.
2. Make a train-test data split to get your own sets of train and test datasets.
3. Once testing/evaluation is completed, print out a statement showing the accuracy of your model on the test set. There is no need to create a separate screenshot for accuracy. As long as the model accuracy is shown in the Jupyter notebook output, it can be evaluated for marking.

### Data Source

- Dataset: `stock_data.csv`

### Basic Expectations

- Good coding practices (documentation, etc.)
- Explanation of the choice of NLP model

### Implementation

- Use Pre-trained [Roberta-base](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base) on Hugging Face to tune the model on this specific task in the context of FinTech News
